More coming soon... contributors welcome. This has come from looking at the source code of [http://code.google.com/p/airstream-media-player/ Airstream Media Player]. I'm not sure if they're implementing pre iOS 4.3 parts that were different to the current implementation. I haven't test it all yet, but will do as I implement more functions. Photos and stop work though :)

How does the iPad use the slideshow themes that are built on to the AppleTV?

How does AirPlay mirroring work, is it a separate command or just a http video stream?
